# Directions
You may REFER to and quote outside sources to help with this, but explanations MUST be in your own words. You may use an outside link as a resource. In which case you must quote it to help with this. However, explanations MUST be in your own words to receive a grade for content. Anything from the source **must** be correctly marked with quotes and cited.

# General Questions
1. Please define & explain the following stacks, the MEAN, MERN and MEVN stack. 
   What are each of its four base components, and what is each of them used for? 
   What purpose do they serve? 

MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js
MERN is an acronym for Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS/ Redux and Node JS
MEVN is an acronym for Mongo DB, Express JS, Vue and Node JS
Mongo is your database, Express is a framework which handles HTTP requests, Angular is a framework which allows the page to be changed dynamically, ReactJS is a library which is used for user interfaces single page applications, Vue is a framework for building user interfaces, and Node.js is an asynchronous model to develop server-side applications.


2. What is the difference between static and dynamic content? 

Static content is content that will always appear the same to every user. Dynamic content is content which may be different upon each time that the page is loaded.

3. What is a server?
